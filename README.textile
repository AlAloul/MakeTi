h1. MakeTi

MakeTi is a makefile script to make using the titanium CLI tools easy!

It builds your code, it highlights the console output... thats it! It's like a stripped down titanium.py so that it can build your apps faster then Ti Studio or by using titanium run commands

Currently only for mac (expanding that soon).

h2. How to start your project

Add the files from this repo to the root dir of your project and type one of the following in a terminal:

<pre>$ make run</pre>

By default, this will build for iPhone using the latest SDK

<pre>$ make clean</pre>

clean delets the contents of your build folder so your next build will be complete.

_* NOTE: you might need to set the ANDROID_SDK_PATH var of the makefile, the default is ~/Android._

h2. Options

You can change the platform by setting the platform argument like so:

<pre>$ make run platform=ipad</pre>

You can adjust the iphone sdk using the iphone argument like so:

<pre>$ make run iphone=4.3</pre>

You can adjust the android sdk using the iphone argument like so:

<pre>$ make run android=10</pre>

_* NOTE: Platforms supported are iphone, ipad, android and web._
