h1. MakeTi

h2. How to start the project

Add the files from this repo to the root dir of your project and type one of the following in a terminal:

<pre>$ make run</pre>

By default, this will build for iPhone using the latest SDK

<pre>$ make clean</pre>

clean delets the contents of your build folder so your next build will be complete.

_* It's not necessary to execute "make clean" on every time because it will force Titanium to re-compile the entire project again, which can be slow._

h2. Options

You can change the platform by setting the platform argument like so:

<pre>$ make run platform=ipad</pre>

You can adjust the iphone sdk using the iphone argument like so:

<pre>$ make run iphone=4.3</pre>

You can adjust the android sdk using the iphone argument like so:

<pre>$ make run android=10</pre>
